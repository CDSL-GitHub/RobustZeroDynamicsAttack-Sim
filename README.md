# RobustZeroDynamicsAttack-Sim

MATLAB/Simulnik simulation codes on conventional/robust zero-dynamics attacks for power generating system (MATLAB ver.: R2017a)

Paper that presents full description on the simulation is:

  "Stealthy Adversaries against Uncertain Cyber-Physical Systems: Threat of Robust Zero-Dynamics Attack" 
  Gyunghoon Park, Chanhwa Lee, Hyungbo Shim, Yongsoon Eun, and Karl. H. Johansson.
  under review.

To execute the simulation, run Power_system_RZA_m.m.
